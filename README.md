# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Overview

A program was created to assist travelers in choosing a destination for a vacation based on the minimum and maximum temperature they desire. Utilizing different APIs keys, we helped the travelers to select their preferred cities based on the weather preference and assisted in tracing a route of four cities to visit in that specific country along with hotels.
